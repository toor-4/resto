<!-- <p>
  flex-basis: 50%; is a CSS property-value pair that is used in Flexbox layout
  to define the initial size of a flex item along the main axis. In Flexbox,
  there are three main properties that control the sizing of flex items:
  flex-grow: Defines how much a flex item can grow relative to the rest of the
  flex items inside the same flex container. flex-shrink: Defines how much a
  flex item can shrink relative to the rest of the flex items inside the same
  flex container. flex-basis: Defines the initial size of a flex item before the
  remaining space is distributed. It can be set to a specific length (e.g.,
  pixels or percentage) or one of the keywords like auto. When flex-basis is set
  to 50%, it means that the initial size of the flex item will be 50% of the
  available space along the main axis. For instance, if you have a flex
  container that is 1000 pixels wide and a flex item with flex-basis: 50%;, that
  flex item will initially be sized to 500 pixels. Here's an example of how
  flex-basis: 50%; might be used in a simple Flexbox layout: css Copy code
  .container { display: flex; } .item { flex-basis: 50%; } html Copy code
</p> -->
<style>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    /* background-color: blue; */
  }
  .item {
    flex-basis: 50%;
  }

  .item:nth-child(1) {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  .item:nth-child(2) {
    background-color: blue;
    font-size: 2em;
  }
</style>
<div class="container">
  <div class="item 1">Flex Item 1</div>
  <div class="item 2">Flex Item 2</div>
</div>
<!-- In this example, both flex items will initially take up 50% of the available
space along the main axis of the flex container. Another example of flex-basis
could be setting it to a specific length: css Copy code .item { flex-basis:
200px; } In this case, regardless of the container's size, the initial width of
the flex item will be 200 pixels. -->
